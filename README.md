eGAS TOKEN SWAP PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT

Purpose of the eGAS Token Swap: 

Independent investigation has shown that the original eGAS token contract, which was created by a contractor for eGAS team contains a coding error that could create more tokens than the originally intended 13,792,050. Unfortunately, the old smart contract cannot be modified and redeployed. The only way to eliminate this coding error is to create a new smart contract where token holders will be credited the same number of new secure eGAS tokens as you own of the current flawed eGAS token. 
 
Schedule & Instruction: 
It is of the upmost importance that you remove all your eGAS from exchanges and transfer them into your own private wallet (MyEtherWallet, Parity, etc) BEFORE block 4568000. 
This deadline is approximately 3 hours before the estimated completion of the swap. 
The eGAS Token Swap (replacement) is estimated to take place by 11pm AEDT on November 17, 2017. 
NOTICE: You will not receive new eGAS tokens, if your old eGAS is sitting in a Token Exchange (hot) wallet at block 4568000. 
Your current eGAS tokens will be rendered valueless after the successful completion of the swap. 

Other Information: 
The new eGAS smart contract address will available for everyone, as soon as it comes online. 
Our GitHub is at this address https://github.com/ethgas/swap. The new contract code will be posted publicly before the new smart contract is deployed. 
The new eGAS smart contract is being audited by an independent coding team and will be carefully tested before deployment. 

FAQs: 
-What do I as a token holder need to do to receive the new eGAS? 
You need to remove all your old eGAS tokens from all exchanges and send them to a private wallet like MEW, Parity, etc. We will distribute the new more secure eGAS tokens once block 4568000 arrives and the new smart contract is activated. 
-What should I do with my OLD eGAS once the new more secure tokens arrive? 
Once you receive your new eGAS, the old eGAS will become worthless, so they can be simply forgotten about or burned. 
-What if I leave my eGAS in an exchange (hot) wallet and not in a private wallet? 
You will not receive the new eGAS. 
How soon can I start trading the new eGAS tokens? We will be notifying the exchanges before the token swap happens. Please consult directly with your exchange for the details about when the new eGAS will be available to trade.
